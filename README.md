# Blood Cancer Detection Web App

## Project Description

This project is a web application designed to detect blood cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The app uses a trained Keras model to predict whether an uploaded image indicates the presence of blood cancer.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of a blood smear for analysis.
- **Cancer Detection**: The app uses a trained CNN to analyze the uploaded image and predict the likelihood of blood cancer.
- **Interactive Interface**: The app is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for users to upload images and view predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-cancer-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd blood-cancer-detection`
3. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install streamlit` and `pip install keras` and `pip install numpy`

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Open the app in your web browser: `http://localhost:8501`
3. Upload an image using the file uploader.
4. View the prediction result displayed on the app.
