# Data Description

The dataset used in this project consists of images of blood smears. Each image is labeled as either 'cancer' or 'non-cancer' based on whether it shows signs of blood cancer.

The images are in JPEG format and have been resized to 64x64 pixels for the purpose of this project. The images are in color, so each image is represented as a 64x64x3 tensor.

The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the CNN model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Please note that due to privacy and ethical considerations, the dataset is not publicly available. This document is for informational purposes only.
